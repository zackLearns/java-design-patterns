# Design Patterns
I created this repo as a practice for learning design patterns and also to help me with future references if needed.

Majoriy of these code are referenced from books and online courses. They are either from 'Effective Java (Third Edition)" by Joshua Bloch, 'Design Patterns' by Gamma et al, or from a Udemy Course titled 'Design Patterns in Java' by Dmitri Nesteruk.

Every pattern has its own package. Every type of pattern has a demo main class to illustrate how to use the pattern.

The design patterns includes:
* Builders
* Factories
* Prototypes
* Singleton
* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy
* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Null Object
* Observer
* Strategy
* Template Method
* Visitor
